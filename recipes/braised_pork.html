        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
        <p>This recipe makes 6 servings of very tender, sumptuous pork.<br>
        Good with very hotmustard and cooked chunks of daikon radish or cabbage.<br>
        It is great cold with salad and a few cucumber slices. <em>Total carbs 14</em>.</p>
        <p>The final simmering process of sake, sweetener, then soy is very unique<br>
        to Japanese cooking, creating flavor-permeated meat. While the recipe has<br>
        a couple of steps, it can be completed while your doing other things.<br>
        It keeps well and is even better the next day. The ginger has a high carb<br>
        count of <em>12.95 EC</em>?. It is not include it in the final total because it is<br> 
        not eaten. The count will also be lower if the sauce is not eaten.</p>
